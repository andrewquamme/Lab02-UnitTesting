# Lab02-UnitTesting

### Purpose

introduction to the Test Driven Development (TDD) process using XUnit.

### Program Specifications

* User interface that prompts the user for standard ATM operations
  * View Balance
  * Withdraw Money
  * Add Money (not standard, but for this exercise it will be….)
  * Keep asking the user to choose a transaction until they choose to ‘exit’ the application
